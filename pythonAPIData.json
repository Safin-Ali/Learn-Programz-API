    "summary" : "Python can be regarded as the future of programming languages. As per the latest statistics, Python is the main coding language for around 80% of developers. The presence of extensive libraries in Python facilitates artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning processes. Currently, Python is trending and can be regarded as the king of programming languages. It is also an absolutely interesting language for beginners and at Geeksforgeeks we have curated a special Python Programming Foundation -Self-Paced course where one can learn all the basics in one place. So learning this programming language in 2022 promises you success and growth.",
